## Project Introduction/Objective
The purpose of this project is to predict how customers would rate their flight experience and identify factors that are correlated to a positive and negative flight experience using data mining techniques. From in-flight entertainment to online booking options, there are a variety of factors that contribute to a positive flight experience. Providing a positive flight experience is crucial for gaining new and returning customers in order to increase revenue. In order to improve flight experiences, airlines may identify and improve the attributes that contribute to positive experiences.
