# Airline Passenger Satisfaction
This is the final project for the University of San Diegoâ€™s ADS 505 Applied Data Science for Business course. The technical workbook can be found at the [main GitHub repository](https://github.com/nlee98/ADS-505-Business-Analytics).

#### -- Project Status: [Completed]

## Project Introduction and Objective
The purpose of this project is to predict how customers would rate their flight experience and identify factors that are correlated to a positive and negative flight experience using data mining techniques. From in-flight entertainment to online booking options, there are a variety of factors that contribute to a positive flight experience. Providing a positive flight experience is crucial for gaining new and returning customers in order to increase revenue. In order to improve flight experiences, airlines may identify and improve the attributes that contribute to positive experiences.

### Methods Used
* Data Preprocessing
* Data Visualization
* Exploratory Data Analysis
* Predictive Modeling

### Technologies and Resources
* Jupyter Notebook
* Python Version

## Project Description
* The [Airline Passenger Satisfaction](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/teejmahal20/airline-passenger-satisfaction) dataset is provided by Kaggle.
*	The following data mining models are used to predict which customers are likely to be satisfied or dissatisfied and determine which features are associated with satisfaction:
    * Decision tree
    * Bagging tree
    * Boosting tree
    * Random forest
    * Logistic regression
    * Linear discriminant analysis
    * Support vector machine
    * Quadratic discriminant analysis
    * Neural network
